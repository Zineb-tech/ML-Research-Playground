# ML-Research-Playground
This repository explores machine learning algorithms, tools, and techniques through hands-on projects. It includes work with diverse datasets, model building, and evaluation. Each project aims to deepen my understanding of ML concepts and track my progress in mastering the field.
repository contains a variety of machine learning mini-projects, including but not limited to:

Regression Models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression

Classification Algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, k-NN

Neural Networks: Simple feedforward networks, deep learning models

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature scaling, encoding categorical data

Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
